# Random-DNA-Sequence-Generator-in-R
This repository contains an R script designed to generate random DNA sequences of any specified length. DNA sequences are composed of four nucleotide bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). This script simulates random sequences by sampling these bases, making it a simple yet useful tool for various applications
